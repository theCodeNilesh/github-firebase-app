## Reflection
This was a  project built during 3rd year of Engineering college as a personal project. Project goals using ```RractJs``` technology to create a react app to  users to pull data from the ```Github API```.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication, here i used ```Firease``` Authentication
